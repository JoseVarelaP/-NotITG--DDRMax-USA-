# -NotITG--DDRMax-USA-
A theme of DDRMAX (American Release) for NotITG.

This theme was created initially within 3 days, during my Finals vacation before going to the final segment of High School, cause i'm going to University shortly (maybe).

# Features:
- Includes functional Radar
- Functional Score display on SelectMusic
- Completely functional Option Icons
- Most things functional for Letterboxing
- Most xml's contain comments to explain the commands contained

and many more

# Need to Fix
- ScreenRedirect for ScreenEvaluation

For some reason, that one keeps redirecting ScreenEvaluationStage to the Name Entry Screen, and i have no idea what causes it.

- Gameplay Crashes on OpenITG

It crashes due to some "Percentage" thing that's going on.
